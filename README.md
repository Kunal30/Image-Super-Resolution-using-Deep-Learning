# Image-Super-Resolution-using-Deep-Learning
We improve the image quality by increasing the resolution as well as the details using Convolutional Neural Networks. We achieve magnification of 2x, 4x and 8x by recycling the same network. We further achieve better quality by including regularization parameter of a smoothness prior in the loss function of the CNN architecture.
